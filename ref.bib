   abstract = {Abstract This article contests the idea that the world has entered a post-globalization era. It argues that rapid globalization has evolved rather than ended. Even though the global goods trade-to-GDP ratio reached its zenith 15 years ago, the rapid rise of services trade has persisted and now accounts for one-fifth of international commerce. The paper makes a statistical and logical case that the future of trade lies in services trade—especially trade in intermediate services.},

   abstract = {This report analyzes the specific factors that affect the competitiveness of developing countries in global value chains (GVCs), and how these factors differ across four major economic sectors: agriculture, extractive industries, manufacturing and offshore services. Although integration into GVCs allows firms in developing countries to participate in international trade without developing the full range of capabilities required to produce a product or service, it will not automatically translate into positive development gains from trade without the appropriate policies to build productive capacity and ensure inclusive growth and upgrading capabilities. In order to inform these policies, it is necessary to identify the various local factors that affected the capacity of developing countries to meet GVC and RVC requirements, including their productive capacity, infrastructure and services, the business environment, trade and investment policies and industry institutionalization. The report identifies the need for further data and analysis in many areas, in particular the trade-related policy implications of TiVA-GVCs for developing countries, including emerging economies. This would provide a starting point for the discussion of the domestic policies and actions needed to promote and support developing countries' beneficial participation in value chains and inform aid for trade interventions promoting effective integration into markets via GVCs.

   abstract = {[This study quantifies the effect of servicification on productivity using firm-level data from Indonesian manufacturing industries. The empirical strategy employed involves two procedures. The first stage is based on the estimation of productivity from the Cobb-Douglas production function using a semi-parametric method. The second stage involves regressing the derived productivity with servicification, which is proxied by the share of industrial service cost to total input and the share of service revenues to total output. The results show that servification is positively related to productivity. The study also finds evidence of the importance of firm heterogeneity, i.e., foreign ownership and participation in global value chains (GVCs) in boosting productivity.]},

   abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of various factors on bilateral services trade, relative to that on bilateral goods trade. To accomplish this purpose, using the standard gravity model, we ran regressions on bilateral services trade and goods trade between 10 OECD member countries and other economies (including OECD member and nonmember countries) for the years 1999 and 2000. One main and interesting result is that services trade is better predicted by gravity equations than goods trade. Another interesting result is that there is a complementary relationship between goods exports and services imports.},
